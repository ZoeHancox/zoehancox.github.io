      <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Hip replacement procedures improve patient lives by relieving pain and restoring mobility. Predicting hip replacement in advance could reduce pain by enabling timely interventions, prioritising individuals for surgery or rehabilitation, and utilising physiotherapy to potentially delay the need for joint replacement. This study predicts hip replacement a year in advance to enhance quality of life and health service efficiency. Methods: Adapting previous work using Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (TG-CNN) models, we construct temporal graphs from primary care medical event codes, sourced from ResearchOne EHRs of 40-75-year-old patients, to predict hip replacement risk. We match hip replacement cases to controls by age, sex, and Index of Multiple Deprivation. The model, trained on 9,187 cases and 9,187 controls, predicts hip replacement one year in advance. We validate the model on two unseen datasets, recalibrating for class imbalance. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and compare against four baseline models. Results: Our best model predicts hip replacement risk one year in advance with an AUROC of 0.724 (95% CI: 0.715-0.733) and an AUPRC of 0.185 (95% CI: 0.160-0.209), achieving a calibration slope of 1.107 (95% CI: 1.074-1.139) after recalibration. Conclusions: The TG-CNN model effectively predicts hip replacement risk by identifying patterns in patient trajectories, potentially improving understanding and management of hip-related conditions.

      <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b> Frailty and multimorbidity becomes more prevalent as the population continues to age. We employ directed hypergraphs to represent the complex interactions among multiple health conditions and capture the inter-dependencies within multimorbidity sets. We introduce the inclusion of ‘Mortality’ nodes into directed hypergraphs. Through the analysis of ResearchOne data, we aim to identify the most prevalent combinations of frailty conditions alongside their co-occurrence with mortality, providing valuable knowledge for healthcare professionals to improve patient care and develop targeted interventions. We demonstrate that hypergraphs enable us to determine the probability of acquiring another electronic frailty index (eFI) condition, understand condition connectivity and sequentiality, and identify the most influential hyperarcs. The findings from this study suggest that hypergraphs enable us to retain progression information compared to holistic views, facilitating the implementation of more effective healthcare strategies.

      <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b> Due to the global pandemic, the use of online courses is increasing significantly; yet the rate of student dropout from online courses is rising. The Accessible Culture & Training Massive Open Online Course (ACT MOOC) dataset is comprised of a temporal sequence of student actions and subsequent dropout information. We introduce a novel approach based upon temporal graphs, which uses the sequence of (and time between) events to predict dropout. The dataset consists of 7,047 users, with a dropout rate of 57.7%. The Temporal Graph-Based Convolutional Neural Network (TG-CNN) models developed in this study are compared against baseline models and existing models in the literature. Performance is assessed using the AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our novel TG-CNN model achieves an AUC score of 0.797, which improves upon previous literature: JODIE 0.756, TGN + MeTA 0.794, TGN 0.777, and CoPE 0.762. Our model offers a novel and intuitive formulation of this problem, with state-of-the-art performance.</td>

        <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b>Objective: This study aimed to predict the risk of requiring a primary hip or knee replacement 1 and 5 years in advance, using clinical codes.
Methods: Primary care clinical codes, sourced from ResearchOne Electronic Health Records between 1999 and 2014, were used to represent patient pathways prior to hip or knee replacement. Patient records were used to train and test models for hip or knee replacement, 1 and 5 years in advance. Temporal graphs were constructed from clinical codes to predict hip and knee replacement risk, where nodes are clinical codes, and edges are the time between primary care visits. Hip and knee replacement cases were matched to controls by age, sex and Index of Multiple Deprivation. The model was validated on unseen data, with performance measured using area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC), calibration and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), recalibrating for class imbalance.
Results: For knee replacement prediction, AUROC was 0.915 (95% CI 0.914, 0.916) (1 year) and 0.955 (95% CI 0.954, 0.956) (5 years) with AUPRCs of 0.353 (95% CI 0.302, 0.403) and 0.442 (95% CI 0.382, 0.503), respectively. For hip replacement prediction, AUROC was 0.919 (95% CI 0.918, 0.920) (1 year) and 0.967 (95% CI 0.966, 0.968) (5 years), with AUPRCs of 0.409 (95% CI 0.366, 0.451) and 0.879 (95% CI 0.833, 0.924), respectively.
Conclusion: Hip and knee replacement risk can be predicted up to 5 years in advance, with a temporal-graph based artificial intelligence model achieving the best performance. This may be used for planning preventative treatment or triaging patients. </td>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Background and objective: Using graph theory, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can be represented graphically to exploit the relational dependencies of the multiple information formats to improve Machine Learning (ML) prediction models. In this systematic qualitative review, we explore the question: How are graphs used on EHRs, to predict diagnosis and health outcomes?
    Methodology: The search strategy identified studies that used patient-level graph representations of EHRs to utilise ML to predict health outcomes and diagnoses. We conducted our search on MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus.
    Results: 832 studies were identified by the search strategy, of which 27 studies were selected for data extraction. Following data extraction, 18 studies used ML with patient-level graph-based representations of EHRs to predict health outcomes and diagnoses. Models ranged from traditional ML to neural network-based models. MIMIC-III was the most used dataset (n = 6, where n is the number of occurrences), followed by National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (n = 4) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) (n = 4). The most predicted health outcomes were mortality (n = 9; 21%), hospital readmission (n = 9; 21%), and treatment success (n = 4; 9%). Model performances ranged across outcomes, mortality prediction (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC): 72.1 - 91.6; Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): 34.8 - 81.3) and readmission prediction (AUROC: 63.7 - 85.8; AUPRC 39.86 - 84.7). Only one paper had a low Risk of Bias (RoB) that applied to our research question (4%).
    Conclusion: Graph-based representations using EHRs, for individual health outcomes and diagnoses requires further research before we can see the results applied clinically. The use of graph representations appears to improve EHR representation and predictive performance compared to baseline ML methods in multiple fields of medicine.

This chapter describes the requirements for encapsulation systems to treat breast cancer. Furthermore, some recent breast cancer treatments that use encapsulation to improve treatment outcomes are compared. There are many cases of successful enhancement of therapeutic drug delivery using encapsulation systems. Encapsulation devices can reduce the systemic toxicity on healthy cells while inducing apoptosis or cell proliferation on breast cancer cells. Using encapsulation methods for breast cancer treatment provide more discrete and less invasive methods to treat cancer, while improving patient reported outcomes. This chapter aims to provide the reader with an insight into the current biomaterials and drugs used in nanomedicine to improve the treatment of breast cancer.</td>

        <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b> By using natural biomaterials, scientists have been able to design and create a range of encapsulation devices with various mechanical and bio-functionalities to hold specific molecules for a multitude of applications. These natural biomaterial encapsulation tools can provide protection from the host’s immune system and from harsh environments. Encapsulation vehicles can enable control of the encapsulated molecules or cells, to allow them to reach the required target location or even direct cell differentiation lineage in stem cell applications. When encapsulating cells, encapsulation can aid cell expansion and maintain cell viability. Cell-matrix interaction, biodegradation, and biocompatibility can be enhanced to improve treatment using targeted drug delivery. Natural materials are attractive for many medical and tissue engineering applications, such as transplantation, drug delivery, cell delivery, and regenerative medicine. There are various natural materials used as encapsulation vehicles, the properties of these materials, including mechanical properties, sources, permeability, and modification techniques, are vital to tune depending on the encapsulation application. In this chapter some of the current natural biomaterials used for creating encapsulation vehicles and their advantages and challenges will be discussed.</td>

Breast tissue engineering may allow that chance via providing more personalized solutions which are able to regenerate, mimicking natural tissues also facing the witnessed limitations. This review is dedicated to explore the utilization of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells for breast tissue regeneration among postmastectomy cases focusing on biomaterials and cellular aspects in terms of harvesting, isolation, differentiation and new tissue formation as well as scaffolds types, properties, material-host interaction and an in vitro breast tissue modeling.</td>

Here, we describe the classification model created by the team “AI_Healthcare”. Methods: ECGs were downsampled to 300 Hz and filtered by wavelet. ECGs were randomly clipped or zero-padded to 4,096 samples. We modified an SE-ResNet to perform multi-task classification of both dataset and disease. We used a gradient reversal layer as part of an adversarial feature learning scheme to learn domain-invariant and discriminative representations. Results: We trained our domain-invariant model on 5 datasets, keeping one data set (Ningbo) for local validation. We also trained a baseline SE-ResNet using the same training data. In validation on the held-out data set, the domain-invariant model had a higher Challenge metric than the baseline model. Our entry was not officially ranked in the Challenge, as we did not have a successful entry during the unofficial phase of the Challenge. Conclusion: The domain-invariant model performed better than the baseline model in local held-out datasets, suggesting that this method may help improve generalisation performance.</td>

Tissue engineering aims to produce solutions to the challenges associated with conventional cornea tissue, including transplantation and use of human amniotic membrane (HAM), which have issues with storage and immune rejection in patients. Accordingly, by carefully selecting biomaterials and fabrication methods to produce these therapeutic tissues, the demand for cornea tissue can be met, with an improved healing outcome for recipients with less associated harmful risks. In this review paper, we aim to present the recent advancements in the research and clinical applications of cornea tissue, applications including biomaterial selection, fabrication methods, scaffold structure, cellular response to these scaffolds, and future advancements of these techniques.</td>

        <td colspan="2" class="hidden"><b>Abstract:</b> The diaphragm is a crucial mammalian skeletal muscle, essential for respiration and to sustain human life. Besides respiration, the complex organ offers a physical barrier between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Unfortunately, the surgical approach for a compromised diaphragm is generally associated with significant risks of defect recurrence, infection, and inadequate growth potential and can cause reformed damaged tissue structures. Consequently, the need for diaphragm resection necessitates the field of tissue engineering to reestablish physiological function and maintenance [1]. Recent therapies employ implantable biodegradable three-dimensional scaffolds to overcome congenital or acquired disorders of the diaphragm. This interdisciplinary field requires a thorough understanding of structural integrity and the diaphragmatic anatomy using pioneered scaffolds to replicate the native architecture, enhancing mechanical properties. The principles of material science are combined with cell transplantation and appropriate tissue perfusion to produce the ideal biomaterial scaffolds, ensuring durability, biodegradability, nonimmunogenic responses, the reduction of morbidity, and reparation to poor muscle contraction [2,3].</td>
